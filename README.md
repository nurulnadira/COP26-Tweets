# COP26-Tweets
For this assignment, we put ourselves in the shoes of two data analysts working at the United Nation. Our task is to examine the impact of the conference on Twitter users and what attracted the attention of the users at the conference. 

We collected the tweets about COP26 conference to our list and tokenise the words to inspect them better. After cleaning the tokens, we looked at the frequency distribution of the tokens, drew a Word Cloud and plot the data. 

The words “world”, “energy”, “future” and “leader” are the most used words as most of the world leaders attended the conference and energy is the main topic that they focus on. The word "patriarchy", which is used to criticize the fact that almost all the leaders of the countries are male, is also among the most common words. The words “car” and “jets” were heavily used as many were criticising the irony of leaders flying jet instead of car to a climate change conference. Considering other commonly used words "crisis", "lies", it can be observed that the conference left a belated and disbelieving effect on people rather than a positive and comforting one. 

Since this code pulls new data every time it runs, the output of the code may change over time. We think that we have achieved a healthy result since we prepared this assignment at the conference time.
